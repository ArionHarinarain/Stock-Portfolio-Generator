### Stock-Portfolio-Generator

### Project Overview:

Given a list of stock tickers, this project generates the riskiest possible stock portfolio with initial starting capital of $500,000. 

### How the project works:

The program first reads in a csv file containing a list of tickers. It then filters out all tickers are are invalid and then runs our algorithm to decide which stocks we want in our portfolio. Once each individual stock is decided, then we simulate thousands of portfolios to determine optimal weightings.

### This project uses:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Yfinance
- Matplotlib

### Awards:

This project came third in the University of Waterloo's CFM competition.
